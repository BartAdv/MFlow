It uses the same mechanism than the <a href=\"/noscript/flows/shopcart\" title=\"\" target=\"\">shopping example,</a> but it is more simple. Since the state is smaller, not only the event (the option chosen), but the state is stored. It is not necessary since it can be reconstructed from the events like in the case of the shopping cart.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"2\">What is different in this example from the counter of the <a href=\"/noscript/monadicwidgets/counter\" title=\"\" target=\"\">pageFlow example</a>&nbsp;is that the former is persistent: You can navigate elsewhere in the application and, when you return here, the counter will have the same value as long as the user session last.</font></div><div><font size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"2\">Note that the user session timeout is set to one hour.</font></div><div><br></div><br>"
